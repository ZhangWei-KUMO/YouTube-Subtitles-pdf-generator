31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
using computer graphics to create
beautiful pixels and then use artificial

Now, out of that 33 million pixels, 2
million pixels were computed.
现在，在这 3300 万像素中，有 2
计算了 100 万像素。

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The other 31 million pixels were
generated by AI.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, so this model text input bots can
generate synthetic data in multiple

在多个

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
mediums.
It understands the physical world.
介质中生成合成数据。
它理解物理世界。

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, for example, if I ask you the
question, if I ask you to generate
因此，例如，如果我问你
问题，如果我要求你生成

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
multiple features of a car driving down
the road, it would understand the

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
would create a driving scenario for the
car that is plausible.
将为
看起来似乎是这样的汽车。

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And so and you open sourced it.
So I don't really think about it as a
所以你开源了它。
所以我并不真正认为它是一个

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
product or a go to market.
It's more about what Cosmos enables.
产品或进入市场。
更重要的是 Cosmos 能够实现什么。

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is that how we should think about it?
Yeah, Well, the autonomous vehicle
我们应该如何思考它？
是的，嗯，自动驾驶汽车

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
industry and the robotics industry is
really important to us and we offer

It doesn't replace.
It augments.
它不会取代。
它增强了。

68

And so you're going to you should
collect as much world data as you can.
所以你应该
尽可能多地收集世界数据。

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course, collecting world data is very
expensive and Elon has a great advantage
当然，收集世界数据非常重要
昂贵，埃隆有很大的优势

data.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And so so I think he has just a
phenomenal position and he's been
所以我认为他只有一个
非凡的地位，他已经为此工作了很长时间

Well, we're a core technology company,
。
嗯，我们是一家核心技术公司，

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and so we build the foundational
computing platforms.
因此我们构建了基础技术
计算平台。

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We're also full stack.
And so we developed the necessary
我们也是全栈。
因此我们开发了必要的

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
algorithms and necessary A.I.
technologies, and then we put it and we
算法和必要的人工智能。
技术，然后我们将其发布

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
put it out to the industry for them to
adopt it and turn it into end market

solutions where we're computing platform
companies.
我们作为计算平台的解决方案
公司。

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So you're on stage and you're surrounded
by, I think, a dozen humanoid robots,
所以你在舞台上，你在包围
我认为是由十几个人形机器人组成的，

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
which is nice for you.
When will I be here at CES in Las Vegas
这对你来说很好。
我什么时候会在拉斯维加斯参加 CES

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and actually have there some robots
right now in real terms?
并且实际上有一些机器人
现在就实际而言？

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You must have a timeline that you see
real world commercial deployment of the
您必须有一个看到的时间表
您昨晚概述的技术的实际商业部署

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
technology you outlined last night.
It depends on on use case.
。
这取决于用例。

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I would say first use the first use case
will probably be in manufacturing.
我会说首先使用第一个用例
可能会投入生产。

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know, there's
estimates tens if not 100 million jobs
你知道，有
估计有数十个甚至一亿个工作岗位

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that are workers that are the world is
short of workers and
这些都是世界上的工人
劳动力短缺和

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
aging population declining declining
birth rates.
人口老龄化下降
出生率。

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And and so I think the the world needs a
lot more workers.
所以我认为世界需要一个
更多的工人。

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Robotics is one of the best ways for us
to supplement all of that and help
机器人是我们最好的方法之一
补充所有这些并帮助

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
companies recover the lost revenues on
the one hand and drive productivity,
公司收回损失的收入
一方面提高生产力，

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
which reduces inflation for the world.
On the other hand.
这可以降低世界的通货膨胀。
另一方面。

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And so I think robotics is going to be
very important to that in different
所以我认为机器人技术将会
这对于不同的

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
different areas.
So you could have probably deploy to
不同领域非常重要。
因此，您可能首先部署到

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
manufacturing first because they
obviously need it most, which you see is
制造，因为它们
显然最需要它，您看到的是

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
a ginormous potential market
addressable.
一个巨大的潜在市场
可寻址。

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a $50 trillion industry that wants
to grow and things to grow.
这是一个价值 50 万亿美元的行业，需要
成长，万物成长。

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sorry to interrupt you.
Jensen.
很抱歉打扰您。
Jensen。

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's interesting that Wall Street is
struggling with this morning, among many
有趣的是，华尔街
今天早上在许多事情中苦苦挣扎

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
things, is
they understand investment there that
事情之一是
他们了解那里的投资

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
drains the foundation models.
In terms of Nvidia's business model,
会耗尽基础模型的资源。
就 Nvidia 的商业模式而言，

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what you outlined last night, Cosmos and
then later on, on the inference side,
您昨晚概述的 Cosmos 和
然后，在推理方面，

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
how physical AI helps grow your business
from that drives growth.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Just simple as that.
Yeah, as simple as that.
就这么简单。
是的，就这么简单。

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think if you if you just look at
simply like we have three computers and
我想如果你看看
就像我们有三台计算机和

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
two of the computers and omniverse
drives an enormous amount of data that

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is necessary to train the A.I.
models.
这是训练人工智能所必需的。
模型。

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right?
And so Omniverse creates the data that

因此 Omniverse 创建了数据

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
we then use to train A.I.
models.
我们然后用它来训练人工智能。

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And the more robots that are that are
available, the more data we can create,
机器人越多
可用的数据越多，我们可以创建的数据越多，

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the more A.I.
models we have to.
人工智能就越多。
我们必须去的模型。

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We have to go train.
That's that cycle is ultimately what
我们必须去火车。
这就是我们最终追求的循环

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we're striving for.
All of that drives consumption from data
。

而且这确实是我们正处于

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And in the future, every single data
center will be

And so I think that over the next
计算。
所以我认为在接下来的几年里，您将会看到
从旧的计算方式过渡

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
several years, you're going to see the
transition from the old way of doing
