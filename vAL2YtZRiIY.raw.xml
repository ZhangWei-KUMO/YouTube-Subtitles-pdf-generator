line at this</text><text start="4.29" dur="2.58">2.3-million-square-foot
distribution center are</text><text start="6.87" dur="2.94">sorted, scanned and labeled,
then loaded into trucks</text><text start="9.84" dur="2.07">destined for the shelves of
the country&amp;#39;s biggest</text><text start="11.91" dur="3.39">retailer. Walmart employs
more people than any other</text><text start="15.3" dur="3.03">company in the world, and
90% of Americans live within</text><text start="18.33" dur="3.42">10 miles of a Walmart. Yet
when it comes to e commerce,</text><text start="21.78" dur="3.63">Amazon is the clear leader
with 39.5% of the market</text><text start="25.41" dur="3.27">share compared to Walmart&amp;#39;s
7%. And with the global</text><text start="28.68" dur="2.52">pandemic helping shift
shoppers&amp;#39; behavior for good,</text><text start="31.32" dur="3.57">dominance in online shopping
is now paramount. Last year,</text><text start="34.89" dur="2.43">people spent more on Amazon
then at Walmart for the</text><text start="37.32" dur="3.21">first time. Now Walmart&amp;#39;s
got a new playbook and new</text><text start="40.53" dur="1.89">leadership as it races to
catch up.</text><text start="42.84" dur="3.33">We have 4,700 locations
across the U.S. and if the</text><text start="46.17" dur="3.78">store acts like a
fulfillment center, we can</text><text start="49.95" dur="2.67">send those items the
shortest distance in the</text><text start="52.62" dur="1.02">fastest time.</text><text start="54.53" dur="2.49">Over the past few years,
Walmart&amp;#39;s built more than 30</text><text start="57.02" dur="2.76">warehouses like this, some
with robots and people,</text><text start="59.84" dur="2.61">entirely dedicated to
fulfilling online orders.</text><text start="62.75" dur="2.43">Workers at stores are also
picking and packing online</text><text start="65.18" dur="2.31">orders, as Walmart turns
dozens of stores into</text><text start="67.52" dur="2.52">micro-fulfillment centers.
It&amp;#39;s added membership</text><text start="70.04" dur="3.12">program Walmart+ to compete
with Prime, invested heavily</text><text start="73.16" dur="2.76">in local delivery programs
in homes and with drones,</text><text start="76.13" dur="1.89">and started packing and
shipping orders for</text><text start="78.05" dur="2.4">third-party sellers as it
works to entice them to</text><text start="80.48" dur="0.39">Walmart.com.</text><text start="81.53" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;d say assortment is the
linchpin to this plan and</text><text start="84.47" dur="2.85">then sellers are a means to
get to assortment.</text><text start="87.5" dur="2.28">They&amp;#39;re looking at Amazon&amp;#39;s
market share saying how can</text><text start="89.78" dur="2.97">we grow this market share?
We need more sellers. We</text><text start="92.75" dur="1.05">need more selection.</text><text start="94.16" dur="2.4">Customers trust us for food
and consumables. They trust</text><text start="96.56" dur="2.73">us for general merchandise,
but they&amp;#39;re looking for</text><text start="99.35" dur="2.7">every item that they could
think of. We want to make</text><text start="102.05" dur="2.13">sure that we&amp;#39;re able to do
that for them.</text><text start="104.48" dur="2.61">CNBC went to Walmart
headquarters in Bentonville,</text><text start="107.09" dur="2.64">Arkansas, for the first ever
public interview with</text><text start="109.73" dur="2.7">Walmart&amp;#39;s new head of
e-commerce Tom Ward to find</text><text start="112.43" dur="2.76">out the truth behind his big
plans for catching Amazon</text><text start="115.19" dur="0.6">online.</text><text start="128.03" dur="3.51">Walmart was founded in 1962
by Sam Walton, growing to</text><text start="131.54" dur="2.76">nearly 2,000 stores by the
time Jeff Bezos founded</text><text start="134.3" dur="3.72">Amazon in 1994. Despite its
in-store dominance, Walmart</text><text start="138.02" dur="2.82">was notoriously slow to the
e-commerce game, not</text><text start="140.84" dur="3.15">launching its third-party
marketplace until 2009. It</text><text start="143.99" dur="2.7">didn&amp;#39;t make real headway
until 2016, when Walmart</text><text start="146.69" dur="2.88">bought discount online
retailer Jet.com for $3.3</text><text start="149.57" dur="2.67">billion, tapping co-founder
Mark Lore to lead</text><text start="152.24" dur="3.6">e-commerce, where he stayed
until last year. In 2018, it</text><text start="155.84" dur="2.4">spent big to get into the
booming online market in</text><text start="158.24" dur="2.64">India with Flipkart, and
also bought online fashion</text><text start="160.88" dur="3.21">brands like Bonobos and
Eloquii. Then in 2020,</text><text start="164.12" dur="2.97">Walmart shut down Jet.com,
although CEO Doug McMillon</text><text start="167.09" dur="1.74">says he would buy it all
over again.</text><text start="169.26" dur="2.7">You look at the trajectory
of our business, it changed</text><text start="171.96" dur="1.89">when we made that
acquisition. The Walmart</text><text start="173.85" dur="4.35">brand really has extended to
reach all kinds of people:</text><text start="178.23" dur="3">affluent customers, younger
customers, urban customers.</text><text start="181.26" dur="2.55">We were going to need a
brand to be able to use to</text><text start="183.81" dur="2.16">attract some of the brands
that did not yet want to be</text><text start="185.97" dur="0.75">in our stores.</text><text start="186.96" dur="2.52">Also in 2020, Walmart
partnered with Shopify to</text><text start="189.48" dur="2.04">bring thousands of
mom-and-pop sellers to</text><text start="191.52" dur="2.46">Walmart&amp;#39;s marketplace.
That&amp;#39;s the term used to</text><text start="193.98" dur="2.73">differentiate items sold by
third-party sellers from the</text><text start="196.74" dur="2.22">first-party merchandise
bought and sold by Walmart.</text><text start="199.41" dur="3.21">2020 also saw the launch of
Walmart+ and Walmart</text><text start="202.62" dur="2.61">Fulfillment Services to
rival Fulfilled by Amazon,</text><text start="205.26" dur="3.03">or FBA, but leveraging
stores and their built-in</text><text start="208.29" dur="1.8">workforce to keep costs low.</text><text start="210.27" dur="2.82">Walmart&amp;#39;s definitely like
doubling, tripling down on</text><text start="213.09" dur="2.16">their e-commerce business,
trying their best to take</text><text start="215.25" dur="2.31">market share away from
Amazon or catch up to them.</text><text start="217.59" dur="1.74">The truth is though, they
still have a long ways to</text><text start="219.33" dur="0.3">go.</text><text start="219.9" dur="2.31">Last year, Walmart opened up
its marketplace to</text><text start="222.21" dur="3.12">international sellers. This
summer, Walmart plus weekend</text><text start="225.33" dur="2.49">is happening for the first
time with exclusive online</text><text start="227.82" dur="2.91">deals for members just like
Amazon&amp;#39;s Prime Day. And in</text><text start="230.73" dur="2.58">February, Tom Ward took over
Walmart&amp;#39;s e-commerce</text><text start="233.31" dur="0.51">division.</text><text start="234" dur="2.19">The nearest Walmart to your
customer is the one in their</text><text start="236.19" dur="3.54">pocket. It&amp;#39;s also the
ultimate store. It should be</text><text start="239.73" dur="3.39">an endless assortment. It
should be completely, you</text><text start="243.12" dur="2.19">know, full of solutions for
whatever customers are</text><text start="245.31" dur="2.34">looking for. And
increasingly, marketplace</text><text start="247.65" dur="1.71">sellers really help us do
that.</text><text start="249.87" dur="2.04">We went to a bustling
conference for e-commerce</text><text start="251.91" dur="2.13">sellers in Las Vegas in
March that&amp;#39;s usually</text><text start="254.04" dur="2.97">dominated by Amazon chatter.
For the first time in the</text><text start="257.01" dur="2.91">Prosper Show&amp;#39;s seven-year
history, Walmart also had a</text><text start="259.92" dur="0.87">major presence</text><text start="260.97" dur="2.16">Because they&amp;#39;re smart, and
they know that this show is</text><text start="263.13" dur="3">where the sellers are, and
they want to get a lot of</text><text start="266.13" dur="2.82">more brands on the
Walmart.com channel.</text><text start="269.069" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s the only other
platforms that it could</text><text start="271.889" dur="1.95">really be competition to
Amazon.</text><text start="274.2" dur="2.22">Michael Lebhar started
selling on Walmart seven</text><text start="276.42" dur="2.04">years ago when he was just a
sophomore in high school.</text><text start="278.729" dur="2.55">At first, my mom was not
happy because my whole room</text><text start="281.279" dur="1.92">was just a bunch of USPS
boxes.</text><text start="283.51" dur="3.39">Now Lebhar says Walmart.com
is his primary platform for</text><text start="286.9" dur="3.15">his Spawn Fitness brand,
which he says did about $3.5</text><text start="290.05" dur="2.7">million of sales on
Walmart.com last year,</text><text start="292.84" dur="2.16">compared to under half a
million on Amazon.</text><text start="295.06" dur="2.61">On Walmart, our profit
margins too are so good.</text><text start="297.79" dur="1.44">Like people are always like
oh, Walmart&amp;#39;s price</text><text start="299.23" dur="1.59">competitive. Which, you&amp;#39;re
right. Like sometimes you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="300.82" dur="1.95">not able to charge as much.
But on Amazon you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="302.77" dur="2.04">spending so much more on
advertising, like you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="304.81" dur="2.73">even realize you&amp;#39;re, you&amp;#39;re
down so much because of</text><text start="307.54" dur="0.33">that.</text><text start="307.9" dur="3.54">The cost of advertising on
Amazon has increased, but</text><text start="311.47" dur="2.28">people are always going to
do it because more than ever</text><text start="313.75" dur="2.85">before it seems, if you&amp;#39;re
not advertising on Amazon,</text><text start="316.6" dur="1.05">you&amp;#39;re not going to get
seen.</text><text start="317" dur="1.17">As the leader, Amazon can
charge sellers more for ads,</text><text start="318.17" dur="1.44">seller account support and
fulfillment services. Jaré</text><text start="319.61" dur="1.77">Buckley-Cox used to work at
Amazon and now helps lead</text><text start="321.44" dur="2.07">Walmart Fulfillment
Services, which launched in</text><text start="323.54" dur="8.37">2020. WFS hasn&amp;#39;t yet raised
prices and unlike FBA,</text><text start="331.94" dur="1.53">offers seller support for
free.</text><text start="333.8" dur="2.22">Year over year, Walmart
fulfillment services grew</text><text start="336.02" dur="4.92">500% In GMV. We add sellers
every day. Our competitive</text><text start="340.94" dur="2.88">advantage and what&amp;#39;s drawing
sellers into the program is</text><text start="343.82" dur="3.09">the fact that they believe
this is a marketplace that</text><text start="346.91" dur="0.93">is built for them.</text><text start="348.44" dur="2.37">But for now, Walmart still
has about a tenth of the</text><text start="350.81" dur="2.37">sellers and a tenth the
value of merchandise that</text><text start="353.18" dur="2.97">Amazon has. Greg Mercer
founded seller software</text><text start="356.15" dur="2.52">company Jungle Scout, which
tracks industry numbers with</text><text start="358.67" dur="2.1">regular surveys of thousands
of sellers.</text><text start="361.28" dur="3.27">The fact that there are
significantly less sellers</text><text start="364.58" dur="3.03">on Walmart, I think creates
less competition. And the</text><text start="367.61" dur="2.28">result of that is the
Walmart sellers typically</text><text start="369.89" dur="2.13">have a more profitable
business than what Amazon</text><text start="372.02" dur="0.57">sellers do.</text><text start="373.07" dur="3.09">Surveys earlier this year,
founded 95% of Walmart</text><text start="376.16" dur="3.15">sellers turn a profit,
compared to about 76% on</text><text start="379.31" dur="0.54">Amazon.</text><text start="379.91" dur="2.94">Five years ago, Amazon
sellers just wanted to be on</text><text start="382.85" dur="2.25">Amazon, they didn&amp;#39;t want to
go anywhere else. But that</text><text start="385.1" dur="2.67">story has changed. Most
Amazon sellers that I talk</text><text start="387.77" dur="2.25">to talk about, how can I
diversify more?</text><text start="390.17" dur="3.33">About a year ago, we
estimated that there were</text><text start="393.53" dur="4.08">75,000 Walmart sellers and
over the past year, we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="397.61" dur="3.42">seen that number double to
about 150,000 Walmart</text><text start="401.03" dur="0.69">sellers today.</text><text start="401.96" dur="2.61">Lauren Stark runs business
strategy for mDesign, one of</text><text start="404.57" dur="2.25">the biggest home storage
brands on Amazon with a</text><text start="406.82" dur="3.18">total of $310 million in
online sales last year.</text><text start="410.54" dur="3.03">MDesig started selling on
Walmart in 2019 and started</text><text start="413.57" dur="1.8">investing more there during
the pandemic.</text><text start="415.66" dur="3.72">Because everyone was at
home. So that&amp;#39;s when we</text><text start="419.41" dur="3.57">really ramped up our
strategy to to go on to</text><text start="422.98" dur="2.76">different marketplaces, and
specifically Walmart.</text><text start="425.83" dur="3.99">Diversify the risk,
diversify the reward as</text><text start="429.82" dur="1.71">well, and reach more
customers.</text><text start="431.65" dur="2.76">Stark says mDesign will
likely do about $5 million</text><text start="434.41" dur="2.94">in sales on Walmart this
year, compared to $280</text><text start="437.35" dur="1.59">million on Amazon last year.</text><text start="438.97" dur="2.91">We are seeing, you know,
really nice increases year</text><text start="441.88" dur="1.11">over year on Walmart.</text><text start="443.41" dur="2.67">Stark says Target has been
even more successful because</text><text start="446.08" dur="2.04">there&amp;#39;s even less
competition. Only brands</text><text start="448.12" dur="3.06">that are invited by Target
can sell on its site. In</text><text start="451.18" dur="2.37">contrast, it&amp;#39;s relatively
simple for anyone to start</text><text start="453.55" dur="2.52">selling on Amazon and
competition is cutthroat.</text><text start="456.24" dur="3">You can take you know some
stereotypical like saturated</text><text start="459.24" dur="2.4">product on Amazon, like a
garlic press or something,</text><text start="461.88" dur="2.58">where there&amp;#39;s 200 of the
same thing. There&amp;#39;s maybe</text><text start="464.46" dur="2.49">like three people selling a
garlic press, for example,</text><text start="467.1" dur="0.96">on Walmart.com.</text><text start="468.51" dur="1.74">But Walmart wants that to
change.</text><text start="470.67" dur="2.67">We want assortment on the
platform. So again,</text><text start="473.34" dur="2.16">customers can come and find
anything that they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="475.5" dur="2.22">looking for and get it
delivered in any means that</text><text start="477.72" dur="0.48">they want.</text><text start="478.44" dur="2.22">Walmart is also adding
assortment by launching a</text><text start="480.66" dur="2.25">growing collection of its
own brands, especially in</text><text start="482.91" dur="2.55">apparel and home, that
appear first online and</text><text start="485.46" dur="2.67">later in stores. But as
Walmart&amp;#39;s third-party</text><text start="488.13" dur="2.97">assortment grows, so too
does the risk for bad actors</text><text start="491.16" dur="2.91">like Mpow and Aukey, two
huge electronics sellers</text><text start="494.1" dur="2.49">doing nearly $1 billion in
sales that were kicked off</text><text start="496.59" dur="2.04">Amazon but remain active on
Walmart.</text><text start="498.9" dur="3.54">They kicked them off for
buying reviews. And I was</text><text start="502.44" dur="4.17">sad to see that Walmart
allowed Mpow and Aukey to</text><text start="506.61" dur="4.08">now sell on the .com
platform. So as positive as</text><text start="510.69" dur="2.61">I am with Walmart, I&amp;#39;m a
little bit disappointed that</text><text start="513.3" dur="2.97">they allowed those two
brands with their practices,</text><text start="516.27" dur="2.91">which according to the FTC,
is illegal to do. You can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="519.18" dur="1.17">buy reviews.</text><text start="520.47" dur="2.55">Walmart says it looked into
the allegations and didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="523.02" dur="2.82">find the same behavior from
Mpow and Aukey on its site.</text><text start="526.47" dur="2.25">As it works to boost
selection, Walmart also</text><text start="528.72" dur="2.34">opened its marketplace up to
international sellers last</text><text start="531.06" dur="0.33">year.</text><text start="531.72" dur="5.13">We know that Amazon had a
big crackdown last summer on</text><text start="536.85" dur="4.08">fake reviews. I think it
primarily impacted Chinese</text><text start="540.93" dur="3.3">sellers the most. That,
combined with Walmart</text><text start="544.26" dur="3.36">allowing international
sellers, we saw like a huge</text><text start="547.65" dur="3.72">uptick in the percent of
Chinese sellers on Walmart.</text><text start="551.42" dur="2.52">Still, sellers say Walmart
remains more stringent than</text><text start="553.94" dur="2.34">Amazon when it comes to
approving new sellers.</text><text start="556.34" dur="2.04">And we&amp;#39;re really proud of
the track record of having</text><text start="558.41" dur="2.7">high standards for sellers
to get vetted before they</text><text start="561.11" dur="2.85">get on the program. And
we&amp;#39;re going to continue</text><text start="563.96" dur="0.27">that.</text><text start="567.53" dur="2.25">Another big way Walmart is
enticing sellers, which</text><text start="569.78" dur="2.67">Amazon can&amp;#39;t match, is the
opportunity to get products</text><text start="572.45" dur="1.95">onto thousands of
brick-and-mortar shelves.</text><text start="574.58" dur="2.76">Because you know, each store
has to get so many cases in</text><text start="577.34" dur="2.04">stock. I mean it&amp;#39;s like game
over. If you&amp;#39;re just like a</text><text start="579.68" dur="2.31">private label seller, to be
able to have your product in</text><text start="581.99" dur="1.68">Walmart stores is like a
holy grail.</text><text start="583.7" dur="2.97">Our product was like at one
point, the number one in the</text><text start="586.67" dur="2.97">category on Walmart.com. So
we got an email from a</text><text start="589.64" dur="2.01">Walmart buyer being like,
you know, would you be</text><text start="591.65" dur="1.44">interested in more talks?</text><text start="593.15" dur="2.25">This year for the first
time, Walmart.com sellers</text><text start="595.4" dur="2.49">were given first exclusive
access to a program called</text><text start="597.89" dur="2.34">Open Call, where sellers
pitch their products for</text><text start="600.23" dur="2.97">space on Walmart store
shelves. Some 2,000 sellers</text><text start="603.2" dur="0.45">applied.</text><text start="603.83" dur="3.18">We&amp;#39;ve got a real mission to
increase assortment. So it</text><text start="607.01" dur="1.68">just made sense that when
sellers are bringing</text><text start="608.72" dur="2.16">high-quality assortment, we
want to make that available</text><text start="610.88" dur="2.52">to our customers in our
stores or online.</text><text start="613.57" dur="2.28">Walmart&amp;#39;s huge number of
stores also makes it the</text><text start="615.85" dur="3.24">undisputed king in grocery.
Amazon bought Whole Foods in</text><text start="619.09" dur="2.67">2017 and is trying to
disrupt the space by making</text><text start="621.76" dur="2.97">two of them entirely
cashierless. But Amazon.com</text><text start="624.73" dur="2.94">and Whole Foods each
accounted for less than 1.5%</text><text start="627.67" dur="2.67">of the grocery market,
compared to Walmart&amp;#39;s 18%.</text><text start="630.76" dur="2.46">Grocery is less profitable
than general merchandise,</text><text start="633.22" dur="2.73">but the real power play is
for Walmart to get customers</text><text start="635.95" dur="2.13">to fill their virtual
baskets with a mix of</text><text start="638.08" dur="2.91">grocery, general merchandise
and third-party items.</text><text start="641.05" dur="2.22">Maybe you&amp;#39;re shopping for
only a Walmart grocery store</text><text start="643.48" dur="2.28">product, but at least that
traffic is there and it is</text><text start="645.76" dur="2.1">heavy and a lot more
eyeballs on your products</text><text start="647.86" dur="0.27">now.</text><text start="648.28" dur="2.58">Despite big upward trends
during the pandemic, both</text><text start="650.86" dur="2.88">Walmart and Amazon shares
fell sharply after Q1</text><text start="653.74" dur="2.22">earnings were reported, as
supply chain issues and</text><text start="655.96" dur="3.18">increasing costs cut into
profits. But Walmart&amp;#39;s long</text><text start="659.14" dur="2.55">standing reputation as a
leader in low prices brings</text><text start="661.69" dur="2.28">an advantage right now, as
customers look for deals</text><text start="663.97" dur="2.16">with inflation at a new
40-year high.</text><text start="667.63" dur="4.2">To save you even more,
always low prices, always</text><text start="671.83" dur="0.69">Walmart.</text><text start="673.27" dur="2.31">As part of Walmart&amp;#39;s
strategy to unite more parts</text><text start="675.58" dur="2.79">of its vast retail empire,
it recently combined what</text><text start="678.37" dur="2.67">used to be two separate
apps: one for Walmart&amp;#39;s own</text><text start="681.04" dur="2.25">goods, primarily grocery,
and another for its</text><text start="683.32" dur="1.62">third-party marketplace
products.</text><text start="685.36" dur="3.48">And wherever there&amp;#39;s
friction in that process,</text><text start="688.84" dur="2.88">wherever there&amp;#39;s two apps
and they should be one under</text><text start="691.72" dur="3.63">one roof, we&amp;#39;re now working
to remove all that friction.</text><text start="695.48" dur="3.18">Walmart+, launched in 2020,
also combines benefits for</text><text start="698.66" dur="3.03">loyal grocery customers with
online shopping perks. It&amp;#39;s</text><text start="701.69" dur="2.34">Walmart&amp;#39;s answer to Prime,
which Amazon launched all</text><text start="704.03" dur="4.56">the way back in 2005. Prime
now costs $139 a year for</text><text start="708.59" dur="2.31">benefits like one-day
shipping on more than 15</text><text start="710.9" dur="3.12">million items, two-hour
grocery delivery in 2,000+</text><text start="714.02" dur="2.94">cities, access to Prime Day
deals and Amazon&amp;#39;s</text><text start="716.96" dur="3.12">entertainment branch: Prime
Video, Amazon Music, Prime</text><text start="720.08" dur="3.3">Reading, Prime Gaming and
Amazon Photos. Meanwhile,</text><text start="723.41" dur="3.63">Walmart+ members pay $98 a
year for benefits like free</text><text start="727.04" dur="2.49">same-day delivery from
stores, free shipping on</text><text start="729.53" dur="2.88">Walmart&amp;#39;s own merchandise,
cashierless scan and go</text><text start="732.41" dur="2.79">shopping at some stores, and
exclusive access to big</text><text start="735.2" dur="3.27">sales events like Walmart+
Weekend happening June 2-5</text><text start="738.47" dur="2.94">this year. And amid
record-high gas prices,</text><text start="741.44" dur="2.43">Walmart just added extra
fuel discounts for its plus</text><text start="743.87" dur="2.97">members who now get between
five and 10 cents off, not</text><text start="746.84" dur="2.64">only at Walmart&amp;#39;s own pumps
but at some 14,000</text><text start="749.48" dur="2.76">participating stations
including Exxon, Mobil,</text><text start="752.27" dur="4.95">Murphy and Sam&amp;#39;s Club.
Walmart is also using its</text><text start="757.22" dur="2.04">stores, and specifically
their proximity to</text><text start="759.26" dur="2.55">customers, as an edge,
making big investments in</text><text start="761.81" dur="1.83">speedy local delivery
programs.</text><text start="763.99" dur="2.34">People are coming to us for
burgers and hotdogs, but</text><text start="766.33" dur="2.61">they can buy a brand new
smoker. They can get a whole</text><text start="768.94" dur="2.55">new swimsuit outfit. They
can get all of that under</text><text start="771.49" dur="2.76">one roof, in one
application, in one place.</text><text start="774.49" dur="2.22">And we can fulfill it for
them with great speed thanks</text><text start="776.71" dur="0.84">to our footprint.</text><text start="777.7" dur="2.25">Last year, Walmart launched
Express Delivery for</text><text start="779.95" dur="2.22">Walmart&amp;#39;s own merchandise
that can reach your door in</text><text start="782.2" dur="3">two hours or less for a $10
fee, with an additional fee</text><text start="785.2" dur="3.21">of at least $7.95 for
non-Walmart+ members. This</text><text start="788.41" dur="2.55">doesn&amp;#39;t include marketplace
items, but Ward says it</text><text start="790.96" dur="1.53">drives traffic for those as
well.</text><text start="792.61" dur="2.31">We can say to a customer:
Hey, you know, add these</text><text start="794.92" dur="2.52">items that you want this
evening. But if you want</text><text start="797.44" dur="3.15">that very specific item, we
can bring you that really</text><text start="800.59" dur="0.9">quickly as well.</text><text start="801.75" dur="2.4">Walmart has been ramping its
logistics operations since</text><text start="804.15" dur="3.36">at least 2017, building 31
separate fulfillment centers</text><text start="807.51" dur="2.7">devoted to e-commerce and
investing big in robotic</text><text start="810.24" dur="2.16">e-commerce fulfillment,
following Amazon&amp;#39;s lead.</text><text start="812.58" dur="2.67">Also like Amazon, Walmart
has independent drivers,</text><text start="815.28" dur="2.34">what it calls its Spark
Network, who handle much of</text><text start="817.62" dur="2.31">the cumbersome, expensive
last-mile delivery.</text><text start="820.14" dur="3.3">We can activate drivers to
come and collect items and</text><text start="823.44" dur="2.85">deliver them to our
customer. But as the density</text><text start="826.29" dur="2.13">grows, the cost comes down.</text><text start="829.17" dur="2.52">So much so that last year,
Walmart started delivering</text><text start="831.69" dur="2.37">goods for other retailers in
a program that calls</text><text start="834.06" dur="0.72">GoLocal.</text><text start="834.81" dur="2.97">We&amp;#39;ve announced some really
exciting clients like the</text><text start="837.78" dur="3.09">Home Depot and the Chico&amp;#39;s
and others, including small</text><text start="840.87" dur="2.37">and medium businesses. And
what we&amp;#39;re seeing is, as</text><text start="843.24" dur="3.63">they share in our last-mile
capabilities, density</text><text start="846.87" dur="2.82">increases and the cost for
both of us goes down.</text><text start="849.78" dur="2.67">In Scottsdale, Arizona, Ward
says Walmart&amp;#39;s completed</text><text start="852.48" dur="2.82">5,000 deliveries with Cruise
autonomous vehicles.</text><text start="855.42" dur="2.4">And this vehicle turns up
like magic outside and they</text><text start="857.82" dur="1.89">can grab it out of the
backseat. And then</text><text start="859.71" dur="2.04">increasingly, they can put
their return in the backseat</text><text start="861.75" dur="2.01">and send the car to the
Supercenter.</text><text start="864" dur="2.67">Walmart also just announced
its expanding drone delivery</text><text start="866.67" dur="2.31">by the end of the year,
deploying them from 37</text><text start="868.98" dur="2.49">stores for a reach of 4
million households across</text><text start="871.47" dur="3.6">Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Texas, Utah and Virginia.</text><text start="875.46" dur="2.88">Customers pay $3.99 for
items totaling up to 10</text><text start="878.34" dur="2.61">pounds to be delivered by
drone in 30 minutes or more.</text><text start="881.19" dur="2.1">In the same way that the
store is starting to act</text><text start="883.29" dur="2.55">like a fulfillment center,
they&amp;#39;re also starting to act</text><text start="885.84" dur="1.41">like a drone launch
delivery.</text><text start="887.78" dur="2.64">And there&amp;#39;s the growing
popularity of buying online</text><text start="890.42" dur="2.91">and picking up curbside, a
benefit Amazon can&amp;#39;t rival.</text><text start="893.42" dur="3">In some of these other areas
where Amazon Prime doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="896.42" dur="1.92">have like the two- and
three-, four-hour delivery,</text><text start="898.55" dur="2.28">but there&amp;#39;s a Walmart store
nearby. You can be living in</text><text start="900.83" dur="2.04">South Dakota or something
and you can get your product</text><text start="902.87" dur="2.91">in two or three hours,
whereas on Amazon, for Prime</text><text start="905.78" dur="2.01">it might take even more than
two days.</text><text start="907.91" dur="1.89">While you can&amp;#39;t currently
pick up third-party</text><text start="909.8" dur="3.09">purchases at Walmart stores,
Buckley-Cox says items</text><text start="912.89" dur="2.67">shipped with WFS will soon
be able to be forwarded to</text><text start="915.56" dur="3.24">stores for possible same-day
pickup or delivery. And</text><text start="918.8" dur="2.46">while Amazon delivers
groceries to doorsteps and</text><text start="921.26" dur="2.91">some items inside doors and
garages, Walmart has a</text><text start="924.17" dur="2.49">unique delivery program
straight into your fridge</text><text start="926.69" dur="1.35">for $19.95 a month.</text><text start="928.22" dur="5.01">It is so good for our
elderly customers that can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="933.23" dur="3.6">get out. Or if somebody has
broken an ankle or</text><text start="936.83" dur="1.83">something, broken a leg,
whatever, you know.</text><text start="938.99" dur="2.4">Thousands of full-time
Walmart associates like Mike</text><text start="941.39" dur="2.49">Edwards spend their days
filling up a fleet of fully</text><text start="943.88" dur="2.58">electric vans with groceries
and general merchandise.</text><text start="946.53" dur="4.406">We don&amp;#39;t step foot inside
the garage or the residence</text><text start="951.019" dur="1.331">without this on.</text><text start="952.8" dur="2.425">Then bringing it inside
people&amp;#39;s homes and putting</text><text start="955.274" dur="2.766">it away in the refrigerator.
Trusting a stranger to enter</text><text start="958.088" dur="2.426">your home may sound wild,
but the program has been</text><text start="960.562" dur="2.572">working well enough that
Walmart is rapidly expanding</text><text start="963.182" dur="1.408">it to reach 30 million homes.</text><text start="964.59" dur="3.027">All of our associates wear
cameras on their vest, and</text><text start="967.674" dur="2.855">every part of the delivery
is recorded. They can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="970.586" dur="3.027">actually access your home
until we confirm that their</text><text start="973.671" dur="2.513">camera is turned on and
working. And so as a</text><text start="976.241" dur="2.97">customer, if you place an
order and you are curious,</text><text start="979.268" dur="1.942">you can watch the full experience.</text><text start="981.21" dur="2.714">InHome associates will also
take some returns back to</text><text start="983.975" dur="2.613">Walmart for customers. And
Walmart is expanding the</text><text start="986.639" dur="2.663">program to include alcohol
delivery and other highly</text><text start="989.353" dur="2.357">requested services it&amp;#39;s not
ready to disclose.</text><text start="994.95" dur="2.13">And so they&amp;#39;re like, oh my
gosh, you&amp;#39;re here like, can</text><text start="997.08" dur="1.98">you walk the dog? Like, can
you take out the trash? It&amp;#39;s</text><text start="999.06" dur="1.35">like, how else can you help
me?</text><text start="1000.74" dur="2.565">While marketplace purchases
can&amp;#39;t currently be delivered</text><text start="1003.35" dur="2.52">in home, it&amp;#39;s another way
for Walmart to build loyalty.</text><text start="1005.96" dur="2.72">InHome offers a unique entry
point into Walmart for a lot</text><text start="1008.727" dur="1.957">of our customers because we
have a pretty</text><text start="1010.732" dur="2.624">distinguishable offering on
the market. And now they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1013.404" dur="2.625">on our website, and they&amp;#39;re
shopping for groceries, but</text><text start="1016.077" dur="2.433">they&amp;#39;re seeing other things
they might want to buy.</text><text start="1018.558" dur="2.243">They&amp;#39;re seeing things
available in marketplace.</text><text start="1020.849" dur="2.624">There are things that they
would never expect to see at</text><text start="1023.521" dur="2.625">Walmart. And so now we have
them as a loyal customer in</text><text start="1026.194" dur="2.433">a much more expansive and
much stickier way than we</text><text start="1028.675" dur="0.955">would have expected.</text><text start="1029.63" dur="2.287">You know, they&amp;#39;re not going
to catch up and be 50%</text><text start="1031.962" dur="2.471">market share next year. But
if they continue to do the</text><text start="1034.478" dur="2.516">things that they&amp;#39;re doing,
gradually they will continue</text><text start="1037.04" dur="2.059">to eat more and more market
share, I believe.</text></transcript>
